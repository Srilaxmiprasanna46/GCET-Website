<h1>Geethanjali College Of Engineering & Technology </h1>
<p>Geethanjali College of Engineering & Technology has been structured to take head on the changing trends of technology. The idea of setting up the college emerged when no other college could cater to the needs of a student in his/her endeavor to acquire wholesome education. The very strength of Geethanjali lies in its principles of providing the right learning environment for the student who does not have to compromise throughout the learning process of becoming global citizen.

The college recognizes that the rapidly changing technological landscape would require young technocrats with an understanding of evolving technologies, but also with a global perspective. A major goal of Geethanjali is to impart a uniquely broad and interdisciplinary Engineering education of the highest academic quality.
